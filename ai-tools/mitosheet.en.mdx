### How Does Mitosheet Work?

When you perform an action in Mitosheetâ€”be it data import, manipulation, or visualizationâ€”the tool automatically generates the equivalent Python code. For instance, if you filter a column to show only specific values, Mitosheet will produce a Pandas code snippet that performs the same action. This code appears in a Jupyter cell directly below the Mitosheet, ready to be executed or integrated into your project.

Here's a simple example. Let's say you have a dataframe named `df` and you want to filter out rows where the column 'Age' is less than 25. In Mitosheet, you'd simply apply the filter using the interface. The corresponding Python code generated would be:

```python
df_filtered = df[df['Age'] >= 25]
```

This feature is particularly useful for those who may be proficient in data analysis but not as comfortable with coding. It provides a learning curve, helping users understand how their actions translate into Python code.
